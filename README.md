### **Course:** Google Data Analytics Capstone


---

## 1. Introduction

The duties of a junior data analyst at the fictional Chicago-based bike-sharing business **Cyclistic** are replicated in this case study.  
I use the full **six-step data analysis framework** to address the company's key business questions:

**Ask  → Prepare → Process → Analyze → Share →  Act**

Finding out **how annual members and casual riders differ in their usage patterns** and turning these findings into **data-driven marketing recommendations** are the main goals here.

##  2. Background: About Cyclistic

Cyclistic is a sizable bike-sharing program located in Chicago that offers:  
- **5,800+ bicycles**  
- **600+ docking stations**  
- Specialized bikes such as:
  - *Reclining bikes*  
  - *Hand tricycles*  
  - *Cargo bikes*

For riders with disabilities or others who are unable to utilize regular bikes, these inclusive choices increase accessibility. **92%** of consumers still favor traditional two-wheel options despite the availability of modern alternatives.

Usage patterns:
- Most riders use Cyclistic for **leisure**
- About **30%** use the service for **daily commute**

Cyclistic’s pricing model includes:
- **Single-ride passes**
- **Full-day passes**
- **Annual memberships**

Riders who purchase single day passes = **Casual Riders**  
Riders with annual plans = **Members**

Cyclistic’s finance team noted that **Long-term revenue from annual members is substantially higher.**
Therefore, the strategic priority is to **convert more casual riders into members**.

## 3. The Business Problem

Long-term growth, according to **Moreno**, director of marketing, depends on raising membership prices. Casual riders are perfect targets for targeted marketing since they are already familiar with Cyclistic and utilize the service.  
  
The company needs precise responses before creating campaigns:

1. **What behavioral differences exist between annual members and casual riders?**  
2. **What could persuade casual riders to convert, and what drives them?**  
3. **How can digital marketing be optimized to successfully reach the appropriate audience?**

Factual insights supported by clean data and strong visualization are necessary for executive approval.
